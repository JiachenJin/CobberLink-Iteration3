== Description ==

üöÄ Let your visitors add new markers to a map (without registration). New locations will wait for your approval before getting published. The map is based on Leaflet.js (no API keys - it's free!).

[Demo](https://www.open-user-map.com/demo/) | [More Info](https://www.open-user-map.com/)

Adding locations (backend and frontend) is as simple as dropping a marker on a map. **Search for addresses** worldwide to quickly find the right spots. Add custom fields and descriptions to the form to get the data you need.

The map is based on [Leaflet JS](https://leafletjs.com/) and offers you many free map and marker styles. So you do not need an API Key, Access Token or any other external registration. There are no API request limits. 

Use the **Gutenberg Block** to integrate your map or place the shortcode anywhere on your site. Close by locations will group together in clusters. Make use of Custom Fields to create the form accoding to your needs. In total there are **more than 60 options** to customize the map.

**FUN feature:**
Let your visitors upload sound to their locations. After your approval audio players will show up. üéµ

=== Howto add a new marker: ===
Just by clicking a "+"-Button a form will popup to let the visitor enter location details the same comfortable way you do it in the backend. After submit the location proposal will be "pending" and wait for your review approval to get published.

=== üöÄ PRO ===
The Open User Map plugin is also available in a professional version which includes more styles, more funtionality and more flexibility!

- **More custom field types**
Add custom fields like links, radio buttons, checkboxes, dropdowns and even HTML. Social media links will automatically be rendered as icons.

- **Email user notification**
Users get notified by email after their location has been approved.

- **Email Admin notification**
Send notifications to an Admin email account on incoming location proposals.

- **User restriction**
Restrict "Add location" feature to registered users only. Redirect your visitors to the registration form.

- **Auto-publish**
When activated registered users will publish directly without admin approval. This can also be enabled for unregistered users.

- **Extend user registration**
Integrate the "Add location" feature to the WordPress user registration form.

- **Custom filesizes**
Customize max. filesize for image/audio uploads (default: 10MB).

- **Custom marker icons**
Use your own custom marker icon.

- **Custom UI Elements color**
Pick a color for buttons and icons that fits your theme.

- **Current location**
Add a button that relocates the map to the users current location.

- **Filterable Marker Categories**
Organize locations in multiple filterable marker groups. Each group (category) can have an individual marker icon and will be accessible to visitors.

- **Limit visible locations**
You can limit the locations to be shown by marker categories and by post ids. So it is possible to show only locations of a specific type or to render only one single location. This can be done in the block settings or with shortcode attributes.

- **Single pages for locations**
Per default locations will not have a single page. This should ensure that all the locations wont negatively affect your SEO. But if you'd like to add more content to locations you can easily enable it in the PRO version.

- **Allow registered users to edit their locations**
Open User Map PRO extends WordPress capabilities to allow backend access. If assigned to the user role registered users get access to read, edit and delete their locations from within the backend.

- **Submit your feature requests (high priority!)**

=== A possible use case: ===
You want to build a map service where your visitors can add locations on their own. This could be a travel blog or a something like our [map with 500+ kite and windsurfing spots worldwide](https://surfspots.locations-and-areas.com).

=== Another use case: ===
Offer your audience a soundmap. The page visitors can not only upload text and images to their locations but audio as well! This way e.g urban (or remote) areas can be discovered by its specific soundscape.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Do I need an API Key or some external registration? =
No, the plugin is based on Leaflet.js and offers you free map styles that don‚Äôt need any kind of registration.

= How to integrate the map? =
Use the Gutenberg Block "Open User Map" or just place the shortcode `[open-user-map]` anywhere in your content or integrate it within your theme template with PHP:

`echo do_shortcode("[open-user-map]")`

you can also override the initial map focus with shortcode attributes:

`[open-user-map lat="51.50665732176545" long="-0.12752251529432854" zoom="13"]`

= Can I set the initial map position individualy? =
If you want to override the initial map focus (settings) just use the shortcode with attributes:

`[open-user-map lat="51.50665732176545" long="-0.12752251529432854" zoom="13"]`

= Can I limit locations to a specific Type only? =
Yes, just add the "types" attribute to the shortcode:

`[open-user-map lat="51.50665732176545" long="-0.12752251529432854" zoom="13" types="food|drinks"]`

= Can I show only specific locations? =
Yes, just add the "ids" attribute to the shortcode:

`[open-user-map lat="51.50665732176545" long="-0.12752251529432854" zoom="13" ids="123"]`

= Do I need GPS coordinates? =
No. Add a new location simply by droping a marker on the map. You can search for addresses as well. If you want to use GPS coordinates though, there is an option for that.

= I want my own fields. Is this possible? =
Yes. You can add custom fields in the settings and use them instead of "address" and "description".

= Can I use Gutenberg? =
Yes! You will find the "Open User Map"-Block under widgets.

= Can I use marker clustering? =
Yes! This is enabled by default. You can disable it in the settings.

= Can I go fullscreen? =
Yes! There is a fullscreen control button on the top left of the map. You can disable it in the settings.

= Can I use custom styles? =
Yes, we encourage you to do so. This plugin is supposed to be developer friendly. Feel free to override the .open-user-map class in css to create your own awesome design.

= Can my users upload audio files? =
Yes! This is a new fun feature. Your visitors can upload mp3, wav and mp4 files and after your approval little audio players will be attached to the locations. The world needs soundmaps!

= Is there a max. filesize for image/audio uploads? =
Yes, per default it is 10MB. You customize that with the PRO version. Be aware that that you may need to increase **upload_max_filesize** and **post_max_size** on your server accordingly as they set the general limit for uploading files.

= Can I disable specific form fields? =
Yes, all default form fields can be disabled. You can use custom fields.

= Can the "link" field handle multiple URLs? =
Yes. They need to be separated with the | symbol.

= How to allow registered users to manage their locations? =
Make use of these capabilities: 'edit_oum-locations', 'edit_published_oum-locations' and 'delete_oum-locations'. Additionally you need to ensure the user has 'upload_files' capability if you want them to edit/upload images in the backend.
You can assign them to any user role with plugins like e.g. User Role Manager.
